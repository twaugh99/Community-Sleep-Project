        <p>You are oversleeping! Contrary to popular belief, more sleep does not always necessarily mean better sleep. Sleeping too little and sleeping too much are both detrimental to your health. People often do need to catch up on a bit of sleep after a period of sleep deprivation, but it is not ideal to sleep for more than 9 hours per night on a regular basis. In order to get a healthy amount of sleep, aim for between 7-9 hours per night.</p>

      <div id="thirdQuestionOversleepingDiv" class="infoDiv">
        <p>If you are having a hard time waking up in the morning, try leaving your curtains open and allowing the sun to wake you up. If you are falling asleep too early, try to get more bright light later in the day. If oversleeping remains a consistent issue, you should consult a sleep specialist.

      <h1 class="infoHeader">The Effects of Sleep Deprivation:</h1>
      <p>When you are sleep deprived you have an increased sensitivity to pain. However, people who are sleep deprived also have a decreased reaction time to pain, making it easier for them to accidentally injure themselves.</p>
      <p>Sleep deprivation also causes a longer reaction time in general. This can easily cause a wide variety of preventable accidents especially when combined with the fact that sleep deprivation also leads to decreased alertness and focus.</p>
      <p>Another effect of sleep deprivation is a lowered immune response. If you sleep 4 hours or less before receiving a vaccination, the vaccination can lose more than half of its efficacy. The effects get worse the longer you are habitually sleep deprived. If you sleep 6 or less hours a week, your immune system’s effectiveness drops a staggering 40-60%. If this trend continues for a month, your immune system can become up to 98% less effective than usual.</p>
      <p>Sleep deprivation also puts you at risk for a number of terrible diseases. Men with insomnia have been found to be twice as likely to develop prostate cancer. Sleep deprivation has also been associated with Alzheimer’s dementia. Not sleeping for even just one isolated night can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. Women who habitually sleep less than 6 hours a night are 62% more likely to develop breast cancer. If these women do develop breast cancer, their breast tumors will be more aggressive than usual. People who sleep less than 6 hours a night are also 50% more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Sleep deprivation also raises one’s risk of heart attack and is associated with increased blood pressure. Sleep deprived men also had a lower sperm count.</p>
      <p>Sleep deprivation can cause dramatic mood swings. Sleep deprivation is also associated with depression. Sleep deprivation can also lead to weight gain by altering the metabolism and can increase appetite.</p>
      <p>Sleep deprivation can also be detrimental to your mental capacity. People who slept for less than 4 hours a night had cognitive decay equivalent to 8 years of aging.</p>

      <h1>Tips to get better sleep:</h1>
      <p>Try to avoid exercising or eating food for a few hours before you go to bed. Exercise is sleep promoting if it is several hours before bed. </p>
      <p>Make a strong attempt to eat something within the first hour of the day.</p>
      <p>Small amounts of alcohol can help initiate sleep. However, more than a small amount can disrupt sleep in the second half of the night.</p>
      <p>Follow a sleep/wake schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up near the same time every day.</p>
      <p>Use the bed only for sleep and sex.</p>
      <p>Keep the room dark and cool. Wake up to the sun if possible.</p>
      <p>Avoid substances like caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.</p>
      <p>Having a consistent  and relaxing bedtime ritual can help signal to your body that it is time to go to bed. Some examples are things like bathing, reading or watching TV.</p>
